Skyfleet, we are thrilled to announce that the first official Android version of our mobile wallet is now fully ready to be released!

We also included a more advanced feature where you can select the specific UTXO (unspent outputs) for sending Skycoin. This allows a more flexible customization of Coin Hours usage for your needs.

Pro tip: For best cryptography hygiene practices, only use each address once and never recycle them!

For the more secure-minded Skyfleet members, you may even select your own node to make sure you are not reading from an adversarial or a hijacked node! To make your wallet even more secure, your wallet seeds are hardware encrypted and never leave your device.
