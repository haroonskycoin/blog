## Summary:

###### Personal blockchains are done:
- https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/blob/master/chaintest.go
- https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/tree/master/src/hashchain

The only thing left is the wire protocol for replicating the chain.

Exchange service is part of the "gateway protocol". The gateway protocol requires coin launch and several other components under development.
