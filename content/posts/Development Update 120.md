## CXO

We did benchmark two days ago and were able to sync 20,000 hash objects in 10 seconds.

The meshnet is being refactored, so that it can be run and debugged in a single threaded context, to avoid the use of mutex and multiple redundant goroutines as much as possible.

After we get the coin backlog done, then we will switch to marketing and launching applications.

## Marketing

We are starting with dedicated marketing and intend to do one content push per channel per week.

We will move the development and technical discussion to our own distributed social media platform on top of CXO as soon as possible.
