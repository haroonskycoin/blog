Skywire Testnet Going Live May 22nd, 2018
-----------------------------------------

Attention Skyfleet! The anticipation has been building, and we're happy to announce the Skywire testnet will go live one week from today on May 22nd. This significant milestone for Skycoin will finally allow users to connect to create the new internet and engage in an inexpensive, faster, and more secure online experience.

> **We are happy to announce the Skywire testnet will go live on May 22nd!**

#### What Is Skywire?

Skywire is the decentralized mesh network that will serve as the foundation of internet freedom for decades to come. Be part of the revolution and take back control from ISPs by joining a network that is 100% operated and run by the community. No more outrageous monthly fees, no more scandalous business practices, Skywire delivers an ecosystem that allows users to experience the internet as it was intended.

For more information about Skywire, please visit: [Skywire, The New Internet For The New World](https://medium.com/skycoin/skywire-the-new-internet-for-the-new-world-6d09a8542c50) we've also got a pretty [Skywire Infographic](https://www.skycoin.net/blog/infographics/skycoin-digest-skywire-overview/).

#### What Is The Purpose Of The Skywire Testnet?

The operation of the testnet will serve as a sophisticated pre-launch program for our upcoming mainnet by stress-testing the network, solidifying the economic model, and ensuring that nodes operate according to protocol.
