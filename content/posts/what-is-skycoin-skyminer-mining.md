## A Skyminer? Are you kidding me?

No, we are not kidding you. The Skyminer is no joke. It’s an advanced yet robust piece of hardware that we’re distributing all over the world. Built from scratch, this little fella will do amazing things!

* Meticulously built from the highest quality components.
* Configured to be the backbone of the new decentralized internet, Skywire.
* Allows operators to earn passive income as it powers the new Internet.
* Acts as a specialized VPN.
