+++
March madness is a good description of the sheer volume of high quality development and progress made across the expanding Skycoin ecosystem. Mainnet launch, hardware wallet updates, and a new CX release were the highlights on the software side of activity.

Within the Skyfleet, Drew Macgibbon lead the charge with the Skycoin Rewards Program, resulting in a number of fantastic new articles and videos by a host of first-time contributors. The first of the Skyfleet Projects was also announced - Skycoin integration into BTCPay Server - this is huge! Read on for all the Skycoin happenings in March.

### Skywire

After ten months of intensive testing on 10,000 nodes of the Skywire testnet, the first iteration of Skywire mainnet was released in March. The mainnet software has been rewritten from the ground up and is primarily focused as a platform for developers to start building the next generation of distributed apps. All existing apps have been rewritten and optimized for the mainnet, including a distributed and secure chat app, SSH, and a multi-hop tunneling proxy app.

Over the course of the next few months we will be releasing new iterations of the Skywire mainnet software with new features, facilitated by an updater that will provide the ability to conveniently install new iterations. Stay tuned for additional information, technical details, and further updates from the team.

Developers are encouraged to install the mainnet software from the [Skywire GitHub](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/tree/mainnet) on a new Pi node and begin testing. Bug reporting should be done through the repo, with steps taken to reproduce the bug, and include any feedback. Details of the process will be available in the README.md and CONTRIBUTE.md. Documentation can be found at the [Skywire GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki). General discussion and support for mainnet takes place on the [Skywire Mainnet Telegram channel](https://t.me/SkywireMainnet).

Upcoming features for Skywire mainnet include:

* A new intuitive UI for developers and users to easily interact with the mainnet
* Bandwidth monetization will be coming soon that will allow users to earn Coin Hours through bandwidth sharing
* Coin Hours bank
* Skycoin transactions utilizing CoinJoin
* Remote management of unlimited nodes
* Port the CXO protocol onto Skywire for distributed data storage in preparation for the Obelisk consensus implementation

Skyfleet, do not install the the developer Skywire mainnet software on your testnet whitelisted Skyminer nodes, as you will stop receiving testnet rewards. If you are thinking of building a DIY miner or buying an official Skyminer, now is a great time. You will help to build out the network and will receive testnet rewards until mainnet bandwidth metering is implemented. The more nodes online, the more robust the network becomes!

### CX

CX is Skycoin’s native programming language. March saw the release of CX version 0.6.2. Check out the [CX GitHub release page](https://github.com/skycoin/cx/releases/tag/v0.6.2) for more details.

CXFX is a graphics library created by _2dbug_ that aims to facilitate games development in CX. It provides a library that allows developers to focus on building their apps instead of having to write everything from scratch. This month it was merged into the official Skycoin repository.

At first, [CXFX](https://github.com/skycoin/cxfx) will be a library-only environment, allowing access to CXFX functionalities from within a CX program. The goal eventually is to have something like a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) (what you see is what you get) game editor, similar to Unity.

To learn more about CXFX, check out the articles on [creating a blockchain game engine](https://medium.com/skyfleet-captains-log/creating-a-blockchain-game-engine-5d4481b0b788) and the future of [blockchain gaming](https://medium.com/skyfleet-captains-log/blockchain-gaming-anyone-23593ebc3545). Also make sure to follow [CXFX on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SkycoinCxfx). To contribute to the project, join the [CXFX Telegram group](https://t.me/Skycxfx),  visit the [CXFX GitHub repository](https://github.com/skycoin/cxfx) and read some [CXFX tutorials](https://github.com/skycoin/cxfx#tutorials-). Skycoin is allocating resources to help advance engine, however this is a community project at heart and will require contributions from the Skyfleet.

### Skywallet

The Skywallet is our own first-party hardware wallet. This month, the Skycoin devs made the Skywallet daemon feature-complete. The daemon will enable Skywallet integration with any future wallet distribution, such as the upcoming web wallet, as well any third-party wallets that choose to do so.

### Ledger support for SKY

A major milestone was reached integrating Skycoin within the Ledger brand of third-party hardware wallets - the first Skycoin transaction has been signed with a Ledger Nano S device!

Stay tuned for more updates as we work hard on both hardware wallet projects, as ensuring security is our highest priority before we will enable use of these devices.
