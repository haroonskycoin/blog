Work on Skycoin began in 2011 with the merging of three separate projects that aimed to improve upon the design and implementation of Bitcoin. The Skycoin developers identified several major philosophical design issues that they saw as obstacles to global use of cryptocurrency as a censorship-resistant payment system.

Skywire, the decentralized internet protocol and mesh network, was created as a solution to answer many of these problems.

### Skywire Mainnet is here for developers to test and help build with us.

After about ten months of intensive testing on a network of nearly 10,000 nodes spanning the globe, we are happy to announce that the developer version of Skywire’s mainnet is launching today!

This first iteration of Skywire’s mainnet features entirely rewritten software from the ground up and is primarily focused on a platform for developers to start building the next generation of distributed apps. All existing apps have been rewritten and optimized for the mainnet including a distributed and secure chat app, SSH, and a multi-hop tunneling proxy app. Many more will be coming soon!

Developers will be able to download, install, build, and run the Skywire mainnet utilizing a command line interface. Full developer documentation will be released over the next few weeks.

This first version of Skywire’s mainnet represents a huge milestone for Skycoin and for the future of the internet. Skywire will serve as an unstoppable, highly resilient network, removing any possibility of censorship.

Skywire mainnet’s developer build is the first release of many. Over the course of the next few months we will be releasing new iterations and features for skywire - we have built an updater that allows us to push new features constantly - stay tuned for additional information, technical details, and further updates from the team.

*Please note: Do not install this on your skyminers as they are running testnet and will stop receiving rewards. Skywire mainnet can be installed on any other device to run, test and develop.*

Bug reporting should be done through the repo, with steps taken to reproduce and any feedback. Details of the process will be available in the readme section of the branch.



### What’s Next For Skywire?

* A new and intuitive UI for developers and users to easily interact with the mainnet
* Bandwidth monetization will be coming soon that will allow users to earn Coin Hours through bandwidth sharing
* Coin Hours bank
* Private Skycoin transactions utilizing CoinJoin
* Remote management of unlimited nodes
* Combining the CXO protocol with Skywire for distributed data storage
