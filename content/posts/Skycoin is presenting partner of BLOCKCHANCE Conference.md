The BLOCKCHANCE Conference Hamburg 2018 creates a platform for the exchange of knowledge, experience and showing deep insights in the field of the blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. The program mix of expert talks, panel discussions, breakout sessions, exhibition zone with product demonstration and networking breaks and afterglow at haven beach club with food trucks, coffee bikes, bars and music is matchless.

Our Team, and Skycoin Fiber projects like Solar bankers, MDL, KittyCash, Distributed Blocks and many more will speak and present their projects. As well there will be a FREE SKYMINER GIVEAWAY among all conference guests. Visit our Team at the Skycoin balcony lounge and get in touch with us.

This event teaches beginners in blockchain about the socio-economic impact of the coming blockchain revolution, and also will allow for advanced crypto enthusiasts to have a platform for community building, meeting like-minded people, and making new friends. Collaborate, connect and learn from successful blockchain entrepreneurs who aim to build a decentralized future.
