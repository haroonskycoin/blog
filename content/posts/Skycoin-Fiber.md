## Skycoin is in a league of its own!

> Fiber can be best described as an infinitely scalable network of blockchains laid side by side, like strands. This is a technological feat that Bitcoin or Ethereum will never be able to achieve, as they were never engineered to scale infinitely.

> Bitcoin’s single blockchain can handle 6 transactions per second (TPS) and Ethereum’s single blockchain can handle 30 TPS. With Fiber, each blockchain strand can currently handle 300 TPS with a target of 3000 TPS in future implementations.

> Fiber achieves this level of performance due to its elegance. Fiber is less than 5000 lines of code, compared to Bitcoin’s 100,000+ lines of code. Large and convoluted codebases introduce bugs, whereas Fiber is elegant and brilliant in its simplicity.

> Fiber is the foundation of blockchain 3.0. Each strand added to Fiber strengthens the whole network and constructs the fabric of the entire ecosystem. Each company and project hosted on Fiber gets its own fully customizable, private blockchain capable of Visa-like speeds.
