The inaugural Skycoin Ecosystem Conference in Shanghai marked the start of a very successful April for Skycoin as the project goes from strength to strength. The hard-working development team continues to make exciting progress on many different fronts including Skycoin itself, the blockchain collectibles game KittyCash, the CXO software and our dedicated hardware suite.

There were multiple updates and changes made to the internal systems of Skycoin. Issues with Skycoin wallet synchronization and micro-transactions were resolved.

The CXO project team replaced back-end user interface of the CXO database with an interface based on Go, added versatility for end-users to choose their preferred DB implementation and improved essential features such as the CXO daemon.

The KittyCash project team released an alpha test wallet, made improvements to the KittyAPI and various features of the Kittiverse library.

From his work in the hardware incubator, Skycoin lead developer Synth revealed photos of the Skywire motorized wireless dish antenna prototype that will free people from dependence on traditional ISPs. Pictures were shown of the Skycoin hardware wallet, a custom Open-WRT router and a single-node Skyminer all of which are under development.

Keep up-to-date with Skycoin development on Twitter, Reddit and Telegram for what is sure to be a highly productive month of May!
