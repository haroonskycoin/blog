On May 24, 2018, Skycoin trading was formally launched on Binance. The exchange has already launched three trading pairs: SKY/BNB, SKY/ETH, and SKY/BTC.

Today the Skycoin team is pleased to announce that Skycoin has entered a strategic partnership with Binance which will enable the Skycoin ecosystem applications to support the use of BNB, the Binance platform token.

Skycoin will support BNB in a number of ways:

1\.   The Skycoin software wallet (desktop and mobile versions) and hardware wallet will support the storage and circulation of BNB. Users can conduct direct transactions between the Skycoin family of coins and BNB in the wallets.

2\.   BNB will become one of the circulated currencies in the Skywire network. As seen[  here](https://www.reuters.com/brandfeatures/venture-capital/article?id=38149), Skywire is Skycoin's decentralized internet which aims at building a faster, cheaper and more convenient incentive network to provide higher quality services than the current Internet. It is a peer-to-peer distributed encrypted mesh network, which means it protects privacy, security and independence. More importantly, Skywire strives to build the Internet for the future and bring equality to it. Skywire testnet has just been released to the public.

3\.   A game developed on Skycoin's Fiber blockchain platform called KittyCash (<http://www.kittycash.com/home)> will accept BNB as a form of payment. Within KittyCash you can own unique kitties and complete game transactions on the Skycoin blockchain.

4\.   BNB payment and circulation will be adopted in all future applications developed within Skycoin to strengthen our ongoing partnership.
